# javapractice
Here is the repository where I plan on applying the Java I've been self-teaching to make interesting projects. I plan on starting out with very basic projects, just to get a sense of what I'm dealing with, then work my way up to more advanced concepts in the future. I hope to increase my love for Java and proficiency at the language through this repository, and I also hope to put codes relating to data structures and algorithms here too (as I will be learning about those in the upcoming semester). I am aware of how to program those in C, but I have a feeling that data structures and algorithms in Java would be much easier.

# What if I have a suggestion on what you could code?
If you're one of my friends looking through this repository, and a sudden bolt of inspiration strikes you on what I could program, by all means please give me suggestions. I could really use those, and if you want to give me some suggestions, just contact me on social media or something.

# Are there any other languages you'll do this for?
Most likely Python, C#, and a few of the languages and libraries used for web development. I already know a fair bit of python, but it wouldn't hurt to refresh my skills in it; also, C# is a language that is used in building the server-side logic for web apps (and it is also another object oriented language which could go well with my skills in Java).
